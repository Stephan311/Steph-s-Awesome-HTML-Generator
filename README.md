# Steph-s-Awesome-HTML-Generator

This is a node application that uses node.js, inquirer, and classes to create a company team syste. This program allows a user to generate an HTML file through Node.js so they can create a team with attributes such as role, manager, email, etc. The user must create a manager first unless the program will not work. Some issues I ran into when creating this program were being able to push the answers of te questions into classes. Other than that, this program went quite smooth.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1. node.js
2. inquirer
3. jest
4. util

LISENCE: MIT
